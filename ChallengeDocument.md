# Web Exploitation Challenge

My challenge is a **capture-the-flag-like** task that combines:

- Common authentication flaws  
- Misconfigurations with insecure web services  
- Multi-layer encoding and decoding  
- File analysis and weak permissions  

to immerse the user in an example of **real-life web service vulnerability exploitation**.

## Notes:

- There are hints, but they are **not readily apparent**.  
- To see whether you have the flag, visit: [https://192.168.64.4/check.html](https://192.168.64.4/check.html)
